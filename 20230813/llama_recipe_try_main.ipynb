Grouping: Group data in a column based on a specific criteria (e.g. by age group) and calculate the total value for each group.\n","Example: `group_ages = pd.groupby(ages, kind='bucket')['age_group'].sum()`\n","4. Ranking: Rank the values in a column based on a specific criteria (e.g. by age group).\n","Example: `rank_ages = pd.rank(ages, method='dense')['age_group']`\n","5. Summarizing with Pivot Tables: Create a pivot table to summarize data in a column.\n","Example: `pivot_ages = pd.pivot_table(ages, values='age', index='age_group', aggfunc='sum')`\n","6. Using Summary Statistics: Calculate summary statistics such as minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and count for a column.\n","Example: `stats_ages = pd.summary_statistics(ages)`\n","7. Using the `sum()` function: Use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of a column.\n","Example: `sum_ages = sum(ages)`\n","8. Using the `mean()` function: Use the `mean()` function to calculate the mean of a column.\n","Example: `mean_ages = mean(ages)`\n","9. Using the `std()` function: Use the `std()` function to calculate the standard deviation of a column.\n","Example: `std_ages = std(ages)`\n","10. Using the `count()` function: Use the `count()` function to count the number of non-null values in a column.\n","Example: `count_ages = count(ages)`\n","These are just a few examples of the many ways you can summarize CSV data. The specific technique you choose will depend on the type of summary you want to perform and the structure of your data.\n","\n","==================================\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_path = './../../example_data_en.csv'\n","\n","data = pd.read_csv(data_path)\n","data = data.iloc[:10,

Total income:\n","Company A earned a total income of $8187 million in 2021, while Company B earned $21777 million. This means that Company B earned almost three times more than Company A in terms of total income.\n","2. Salaries and wages paid:\n","Company A paid salaries and wages of $279 million in 2021, while Company B paid $105 million. This means that Company A paid almost three times more than Company B in terms of salaries and wages paid.\n","3. Sales, government funding, grants and subsidies:\n","Company A earned $8866 million in sales, government funding, grants and subsidies in 2021, while Company B earned $16756 million. This means that Company B earned almost twice more than Company A in terms of sales, government funding, grants and subsidies.\n","4. Total expenditure:\n","Company A had total expenditure of $7618 million in 2021, while Company B had total expenditure of $14458 million. This means that Company B had almost twice more than Company A in terms of total expenditure.\n","5. Operating profit before tax:\n","Company A had an operating profit before tax of $770 million in 2021, while Company B had an operating profit before tax of $236 million. This means that Company A had almost three times more than Company B in terms of operating profit before tax.\n","6.
